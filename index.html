        <p>Hey! I'm <strong>Guilherme</strong>. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps. 
        Learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. 
        I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job.</p>
